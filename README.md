# ML Zoomcamp Homework

## Course Description
This is a practical course where I learn to build and deploy machine learning systems. This course focus on the engineering side from training models to getting them to work in production.

Things I would learn:
- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Preparing data, feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow
